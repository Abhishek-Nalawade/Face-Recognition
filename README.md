# Face Recognition
## About
The aim of this project is to implement dierent classifiers to achieve face recognition.\
The following algorithms are implemented to achieve face recognition:\
1. Bayes' Classifier\
2. k-NN\
3. Kernel SVM\
4. Boosted SVM\

In addition to the above algorithms, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) is implemented 
before feeding the data to any of the classifiers.


## Run Instructions
1. Please run the code "Execute_all_codes.py" file to run the algorithms
2. When the above file is executed you will get prompts to run the desired algorithm
3. Enter the numbers as input corresponding to the desired output
